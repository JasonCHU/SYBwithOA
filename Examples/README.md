# Examples

Source code of the examples shown in the paper can be found here. Since __Shy__ is based on Object Algebras and Java annotations, with those examples you'll be able to find how a simple annotation "@Algebra" helps to implement traversals of complex AST structures easily.

For more details on the usage of "@Algebra", please click: https://github.com/JasonCHU/SYBwithOA/tree/master/Shy

## How to build

Simply import this directory into Eclipse IDE you are using. Don't forget to make sure Java 8 is available in your Eclipse.
